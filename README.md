<h3> Who is myLexa </h3>
üéóÔ∏è An Alexa clone that control browser,  get some Wikipedia data or tell some funny jokes

<h3> Requirements </h3>
pyttsx3 - <code> pip install pyttsx2</code> - used to convert text to speech

SpeechRecognition - <code>pip install SpeechRecognition </code> - listen to our voice

pywhatkit - <code>pip install pywhatkit</code> - get some controls on the browser

wikipedia - <code>pip install wikipedia</code> - catch wikipedia data

pyjokes - <code>pip install pyjokes </code> - to get funny jokes

<h3>index.js</h3>

Starting by import the packages we need 

<pre>
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import pywhatkit
import datetime
import wikipedia
import pyjokes
</pre>

Then we need to initialize some variables necessary to myLexa
<pre>
listener = sr.Recognizer() // initialize the voice recognizer
engine = pyttsx3.init() // initialize the text to speech engine
voices = engine.getProperty('voices') // To get all propr
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
</pre>

<code>listener = sr.Recognizer()</code> Initialize the voice recognizer

<code>engine = pyttsx3.init()</code> Initialize the text to speech engine

<code>voices = engine.getProperty('voices')</code> To get our robot voice

<code> engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id) </code> To choose the voice of myLexa 

Then this small function permits simply to the robot to talk : 

<pre>
def talk(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()
</pre>

Once the myLexa can talk, we need to learn her to get and understand the command, with this function <code>take_command()</code> : 
<pre>
def take_command():
    try:
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print("I'm listening")
            voice = listener.listen(source)
            command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
            command = command.lower()
            if 'alexa' in command:
                command = command.replace('alexa', '')
                print(command)
    except:
        pass
    return command
 </pre>
 
 Finaly, we just add some features like search for information about a person or tell jokes (& more) : 
 <pre>
 def run_alexa():
    command = take_command()
    print(command)
    if 'play' in command:
        song = command.replace('play', '')
        talk('playing ' + song)
        pywhatkit.playonyt(song)
    elif 'time' in command:
        time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p')
        talk('Current time is ' + time)
    elif "Sorry, i don't know" in command:
        person = command.replace("Sorry, i don't know", '')
        info = wikipedia.summary(person, 1)
        print(info)
        talk(info)
    elif 'date' in command:
        talk('sorry, I have a headache')
    elif 'are you single' in command:
        talk('I am in a relationship with wifi')
    elif 'joke' in command:
        talk(pyjokes.get_joke())
    else:
        talk('Please repeat the command.')
<pre>

To get alexa running during all our script, we need to run this loop : 
<pre>
while True:
    run_alexa()
</pre>
